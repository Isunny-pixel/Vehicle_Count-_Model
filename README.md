# Vehicle_Count-_Model
Implementing unsupervised learning model with the help of OpenCV image processing, to detect objects that are in motion based on the difference in the frames of the given data-set (which is a video). The input will be location of the video and two coordinates to decide a crossing line for the vehicle in motion.
